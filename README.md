Throughout this course I was able to get a better sense of how I approach both design and development decisions when it comes to software. I thoroughly enjoyed this course as it was very iterative with each week building on the previous one. When writing code I generally abide by the philosophy of make it work, make it right, then make it fast. For example, my primary focus when creating each of the individual objects in my scene was not to make it perfect right away. Instead, it was to get a rough finish and then refine it at a later time when it became appropriate. I would not neccessarily say that I developed any new design or development skills, but rather I continued to improve and refine my current processes of doing things.
